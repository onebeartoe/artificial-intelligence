# Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence is software development’s attempt to simulate human capabilities like problem solving, analysis of data, and predictions based on data.

Machine learning includes image analysis, voice recognition.

Deep Learning uses neural networks to make decisions between network nodes to form a final output; categorization, sentiment, chatbots

## Natural Language Prossing (NLP)

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large language models aim to understand and generate natural sounding human speech in the form of text.


## Deep Learning
	
The deep learning I have done is in [this repository](https://github.com/onebeartoe/deep-learning).

   

## Agents

Artificial intelligence agents provide a way for humans to interact with pre-trained models for productivity, automation, and in the software development lifecycle.



### Gemini Browser-Based Services

---STILL IN GOOGLE DRIVE DOC---


### Gemini CLI

One agent offered by Google is Gemini CLI.

Here are some steps/commands to get started on the command line:

Configure the Authentication for Google Cloud (and Application Default Credentials (ADC) )
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg curl

sudo snap install google-cloud-cli 

sudo snap install google-cloud-cli --classic

gcloud

// This next opens a browser for authentication.

gcloud auth application-default login

gemini

cp /home/luke/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json ~/Versioning/owner/
betoland-owner/Accounts/google/ai/


Once I had my Google Gemini/Vertex credentials, [Romin Irani’s 11 part guide](https://medium.com/google-cloud/gemini-cli-tutorial-series-77da7d494718) was really fun to go through.
