Using Gemini with CLI or in a programmatic way (Java/Python), requires setting up API keys for your environment.

## See the [configuration directory](configuration/readme.md) for sample configuration files

# Verify the Installation

Here is an example prompt to issue to verify Gemini is set up correctly for the local environment:

```
gemini "what is the weather like in Bandera, TX?"
```

The terminal should print a weather forecast.
