# Music - Google Gemini Browser-Based Agents


I used the Google Gemini browser based agents to create some 'music'.

See the music prompt file for details.

This prompt gave 4 .wav files that sounded 'okay' to me, based on my prompt.

For upload to Github, I used Gemini CLI to reduce the file size.  See the 'Audio' section under Gemini CLI for that prompt.
