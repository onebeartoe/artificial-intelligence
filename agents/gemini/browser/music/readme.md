# Music - Google Gemini Browser-Based Agents


I used the Google Gemini browser based agents to create some 'music'.

See the [FUNKY_LITTLE_BEAT](../../../gemini/programmatic/images/prompts/src/main/java/org/onebeartoe/prompts/Prompts.java) music prompt file for details.

This prompt gave 4 .wav files that sounded 'okay' to me, based on my prompt.  I compressed the .wav files to .flac format.  They are in this directory.

<audio controls>
    <source src="music1.flac" type="audio/flac">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.

</audio>

----

<video src='music1.flac'>
</video>


For upload to Github, I used Gemini CLI to reduce the file size.  See the 'Audio' section under Gemini CLI for the [corresponding prompt](../../cli/audio/readme.md).
