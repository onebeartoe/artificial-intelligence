1. The top of a 25-foot ladder, leaning against a vertical wall, is slipping down the
wall at the rate of 1 foot per minute. How fast is the bottom of he ladder slipping
along the ground when the bottom of the ladder is 7 feet away from the base of
the wall?

2. A particle moves on the hyperbola x^2 -18y^2 = 9 in such a way that its y -
coordinate increases at a constant rate of 9 units/sec. How fast is its x -
coordinate changing when x = 9 ?

3. If the radius of a sphere is increasing at the constant rate of 3mm per second, how
fast it is the volume changing when the surface area (4πr^2) is 10 mm²?

4. A balloon is being inflated by pumping in air at the rate of 2 cubic inches per
second. How fast is the diameter of the balloon increasing when the radius is
one-half inch?

5. A particle moves along the curve y = 2x^3-3x^2+4. At a certain moment, when
x = 2, the particle's x-coordinate is increasing at the rate of 0.5 unit per second.
How fast is its y -coordinate changing at that moment?
