# Audio - Google Gemini CLI Agents


In the browser-based section, I documented a [prompt to create some 'music'](../../browser/music/readme.md).  It created the files in .wav format.

I used the [REDUCE_FILESIZE_BUT_NOT_QUALITY](../../../gemini/programmatic/images/prompts/src/main/java/org/onebeartoe/prompts/Prompts.java) to reduce the size of the file, for upload to Github.

This prompted Gemini to use ffmpeg to compress to a lossless format, FLAC.

File size reduction was reported as 40%.
