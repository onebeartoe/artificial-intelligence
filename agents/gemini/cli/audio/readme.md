# Audio - Google Gemini CLI Agents


In the browser-based section, I documented a prompt to create some 'music'.  It created the files in .wav format.

I used the size-reduction.prompt to reduce the size of the file, for upload to Github.

This prompted Gemini to use ffmpeg to compress to a lossless format, FLAC.

File size reduction was reported as 40%.
